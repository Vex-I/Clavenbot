# Clavenbot

<p>
This is a simple discord bot that I made for Clavo-gaming Discord server. Most of the planned features are Minecraft-related, with basic integration with MojangAPI and the minecraft server itself.

<ul>
  <li>Coordinate Logging</li>
  <li>Server Status Query</li>
  <li>Displaying the Minecraft Meme of the Day</li>
  <li>Basic Bot Functions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>First, clone this repository. You should the rename the example.env file to just .env. Never push this file to github, as it would contain your bot token</p>
<p>If you haven't already, simply create a discord application <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications">here</a>. 
  Then, proceed to get the bot token from the bot menu (DO NOT SHARE THIS TOKEN). Replace the TOKEN field in .env with this token.</p>
<p>You'll retrieve the reddit application in the same manner <a href ="https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps"> here </a> (you'll need an account if you haven't already).
  Create an agent and paste your CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET into the .env file.
